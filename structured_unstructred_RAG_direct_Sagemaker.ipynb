    "  \"Structured Database Response (Narrative Summary)\": \"**Compound Evaluated**: Phenacetin (CCOc1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1)\\n---\\n\\nNumber of records analysed: 44. **Conclusion**: Based on the findings, Phenacetin exposure resulted in statistically significant increases in various tumor types across multiple organs in mice and rats, with evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in the lung, forestomach, kidney, nasal cavity, urinary bladder, and other sites. The reliability of these studies was rated as 4 (not assignable), and potency estimates (goldTD50) ranged from low to high across different tumor types and organs. These findings provide evidence that Phenacetin exhibits carcinogenic activity in rodents. There is no data present in Vitic directly measuring carcinogenicity in humans, but positive evidence from other species and implicated mechanisms of action may have relevance to humans.\\n\\n**Study Findings**:\\n\\n---\\n- In chronic study test studies, mice (B6C3F1 strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 96 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected lung showed an increased incidence of adenoma, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 6890 indicating moderate potency, with a p-value <= 0.091 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In chronic study test studies, rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 117 weeks with a study duration of 117 weeks via diet route, affected forestomach showed an increased incidence of papilloma-squamous cell, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 2690 indicating high potency, with a p-value <= 0.092 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In chronic study test studies, rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 117 weeks with a study duration of 117 weeks via diet route, affected kidney-cortex showed an increased incidence of tumour-renal cell, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 1300 indicating high potency, with a p-value <= 0.016 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In 18-month study test studies, rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 78 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected multiple sites showed an increased incidence of multiple tumour types, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 2730 indicating high potency, with a p-value <= 0.0005 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In 18-month study test studies, rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 78 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected nasal cavity showed an increased incidence of adenocarcinoma, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 7730 indicating moderate potency, with a p-value <= 0.004 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In 18-month study test studies, rats (Sprague-Dawley strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 78 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected urinary bladder showed an increased incidence of carcinoma-transitional cell, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 2710 indicating high potency, with a p-value <= 0.0005 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In chronic study test studies, mice (B6C3F1 strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 96 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected urinary bladder showed an increased incidence of papilloma and carcinoma-transitional cell, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with a goldTD50 of 37000 indicating low potency, with a p-value <= 0.093 indicating a statistically significant increase.\\n- In chronic study test studies, mice (B6C3F1 strain) exposed to Phenacetin for an exposure duration of 96 weeks with a study duration of 104 weeks via diet route, affected kidney showed an increased incidence of adenoma-renal cell and carcinoma-renal cell, with a reliability of 4 (not assignable) indicating a positive result, with goldTD50s of 1100 and 4020 indicating high and moderate potencies respectively, with p-values <= 0.0005 indicating statistically significant increases.\",\n",
