    "Based on the search results, there is some evidence that both omeprazole and pantoprazole may have carcinogenic potential in rodents, but their carcinogenic potential in humans is not definitively established. Omeprazole has been reported to induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa of rodents, suggesting it may be a potential genotoxic carcinogen, possibly due to an unstable sulphenimide metabolite (source 2). Pantoprazole has shown positive carcinogenic effects in rats and mice, causing stomach, liver, and thyroid tumors in rodent studies (source 4). However, the evidence regarding carcinogenicity in humans is less clear. Source 4 notes that FDA labels for both omeprazole and pantoprazole include a precaution about potential gastric malignancy, but definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. More studies are needed to determine if the carcinogenic effects observed in rodents translate to humans taking these drugs (source 1).\n",
