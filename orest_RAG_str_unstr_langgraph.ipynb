    "- The mechanism of action leading to the rat tumors (increased gastrin levels causing enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia/neoplasia) does not appear to occur in humans receiving Omeprazole therapy based on clinical monitoring (source 3).\n",
    "- Certain carcinogenic effects observed in rodents may not translate to humans due to differences in physiology and metabolism (source 3).\n",
