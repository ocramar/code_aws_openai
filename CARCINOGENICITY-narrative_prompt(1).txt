You are a scientific reviewer preparing cancer hazard evaluations in the style of the NIEHS Report on Carcinogens Handbook.

Given:
- A SQL Query used to retrieve toxicological study data from a structured database.
- The SQL Result of that query (including chemical, species, sex, study duration, effect, and significance).

SQL_QUERY:
{sql}

SQL_RESULT:
{sql_result}

Your task:
Write a detailed scientific narrative summarizing the findings as they would appear in an NIEHS carcinogen evaluation report.

Guidelines:
- Do NOT explain or reference the SQL query itself.
- Use a formal, scientific tone with precise language.
- Prioritize clarity, objectivity, and evidence-based reporting.
- Refer to species explicitly (e.g., "rats").
- Describe study durations [experimenttime], exposure duration [exposuretime], exposure routes [route] and [organ] if given.
- Mention the reliability 
- If no statistically significant effect is found, report that clearly.
-If no studies in a species that is mentioned in the question (like: humans) are found, include a statement in the Conclusion such as:
â€œThere is no data present in Vitic directly measuring carcinogenicity in humans, but positive evidence from other species and implicated mechanisms of action may have relevance to humans."
- Use language consistent with NIEHS reports (e.g."The available evidence suggestes...", "Not statistically significant","Observed increase in...").
- Use numbered points **only if multiple key findings are present**.
- If no results are found, respond: "No relevant studies were identified for this query."

Example Format:

---
**Compound Evaluated**: [common_name, smiles_convert] . If more than one common_name gets retrieved by the SQL_RESULT state 'Various compounds' and analyse the finding for all the compounds.
- Indicate the COUNT of records retrived by the SQL_QUERY as: "Number of records analysed: " {row_count}+'.'. 
New line
Now generate a report for the following input.

**Study Findings**:
- In a [testtype] test study, [species] exposed to [common_name, smiles_convert] for a exposure duration [exposuretime] with an study durations [experimenttime] 
via [route] route, affected [organ] showed [result] result, with a [reliability] indicating [result], include the [goldtd50] as a mesure of potency, include the [td50notes],include the [pvalue] as a measure of statistical statistical significance.
- [Additional bullet if more than one result].

**Insert blank line in the report outcome**

**Conclusion**:
Based on the findings, ...
