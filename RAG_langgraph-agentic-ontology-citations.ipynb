    " Based on the search results, there is some evidence that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, may play a role in breast cancer development and proliferation. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DHT was found to stimulate cell proliferation in both estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and estrogen receptor-negative (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cell lines in vitro (source 5).\n",
    "- In MCF-7 cells, the proliferative effect of DHT appeared to involve the estrogen receptor, as it could be blocked by an estrogen receptor inhibitor or by knocking down estrogen receptor expression (source 5).\n",
    "- In MDA-MB-231 cells, DHT's effect on proliferation involved a novel mechanism related to the integrin αvβ3, as blocking this integrin eliminated DHT's proliferative effect (source 5). However, the evidence from epidemiological studies linking DHT or its precursor testosterone to breast cancer risk in humans is limited. Most of the evidence relates to the organochlorine pesticide DDT and its metabolite DDE, which have been found to have estrogen-mimicking effects. Several case-control studies reported increased breast cancer risk associated with higher levels of DDE (sources 1 and 3)."

However, one result states that treatment with PUVA (psoralen plus UVA radiation), which is a different compound, produces reactive oxygen species that may play a role in cytotoxicity (source 4). But there is no clear evidence provided about phenacetin specifically causing oxidative stress."

    " Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that has been shown to be carcinogenic in both experimental animals and humans. There is sufficient evidence that DES is carcinogenic in animals after either prenatal or postnatal exposure, causing tumors in various organs including the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovary, mammary gland, and testis in mice. In humans, DES exposure in utero has been linked to an increased risk of clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix in daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy. The carcinogenic potential of DES is thought to involve both its estrogenic effects as well as metabolic activation to reactive metabolites that can damage cellular macromolecules like DNA. DES is metabolized to catechol metabolites that can be further oxidized to reactive quinones capable of forming DNA adducts, which may lead to cancer-initiating mutations. The developmental changes caused by prenatal DES exposure may also create a tissue environment conducive to carcinogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms."
