    "The evidence suggests that Omeprazole may be carcinogenic in rats, as it caused a statistically significant increase in malignant carcinoid tumors in the gastric mucosa in two-year rat studies.

While the data shows carcinogenic effects in rats, there is no direct evidence provided on carcinogenicity in humans.

The evidence in mice is more equivocal, with some studies showing negative results and others being inconclusive.
