      "Before the classification as a carcinogen, the carcinogenicity of a chemical compound should be previously assessed by a scientific approach (21). A substance is defined as carcinogenic after an extensive study by researchers. One or more agencies evaluate the evidence and determine it to be a cause of cancer (5). Testing to see if something may induce cancer is often difficult. Experimental assays with animal models and in vitro assays as well as epidemiological studies allow the recognition of carcinogenic chemical compounds and the analysis of many aspects of chemical carcinogenesis. However, these tests do not always give clear answers. In some cases, the compounds seem to be genotoxic in one study or one test only (e.g. only in vitro or in vivo). This is difficult to explain and cause controversial discussions (3). In some cases, the compounds are classified as “likely to cause cancer in humans” without considering the mode of action and dose response, leading to confusion. Labeling chemical compounds as “human carcinogens” does not indicate nothing about the dose-response and the relevance of the risk.  Animal models Studies in animals are important to study the mode of action of the chemical carcinogens and for risk assessment. From an experimental point of view, a chemical compound is considered carcinogenic when its administration to laboratory animals induces a statistically significant increase in the incidence of one or more histological types of neoplasia,\n"
